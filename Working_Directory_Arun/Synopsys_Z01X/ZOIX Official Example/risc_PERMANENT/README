Step 1:

Compile the design.

Inputs: 
  run.f - List of design files to compile
  strobe.sv - Strobe data for fault simulation
Command:
  $ZOIXHOME/bin/zoix ...
Outputs:
  Z01X created executable (zoix.sim)
  Z01X created design database (sim.zdb)
  Z01X created logfile (zoix.log)

Step 2:

Configure the fault universe.

Edit the Standard Fault File (risc.sff)

The Standard Fault File (SFF) is used to configure where permanent faults are
created, and when and wher transient faults are injected.

Inputs:
  None or SFF template
Command:
  None
Outputs:
  Updated SFF

Step 3:

Run Fault Manager (fmsh).

fmsh is the controlling process for running testability, fault injections, and
creating coverage reports.

Inputs:
  User configured Fault Manager Script
  Z01X created Design Database
  User configured Standard Fault File
  User created simulus (VCD, eVCD, testbench)
Command:
  $ZOIXHOME/bin/fmsh -load risc.fmsh
Outputs:
  Z01X created coverage reports
  fmsh logfile

NOTE: All steps after Step 3 are run through the fault manager interface, fmsh
Step 4:

Import Design and Fault List

Inputs:
  Z01X created design database and executable
  User configured SFF
Command:
  set(var=[defines], format=[standard])
  set(var=[fdef], method=[fr], fr.fr=[user_coverage.sff])
  design()
Outputs:
  Z01X created fault import logfile (fr2fdef.log)
  Z01X created fmsh log (fmsh.log)
  Z01X created Fault Definition File (sim.fdef)

Step 5:

Import Tests

Inputs:
  User created stimulus file(s)
Command:
  addtst(test=[user_test1], stimtype=[tb])
Outputs:
  Z01X created fmsh log (fmsh.log)

Step 6:

Run Testability

Inputs:
  Z01X created design database and executable
  User created stimulus
Command:
  None.  Automatically run by fsim command.
Outputs:
  Z01X created testability report (testability.txt)
  Testability logfiles (in __tests__ and __fubs__)
  Z01X created fmsh log (fmsh.log)

Step 7:

Run Fault Simulation

Inputs:
  Z01X created design database and executable
  User created stimulus
  Z01X created Fault Definition File (sim.fdef)
Command:
  fsim()
Outputs:
  Z01X created Fault Definition File (sim.fdef)
  Z01X created fmsh log (fmsh.log)
  Z01X created logfiles (__fubs__/design/user_test1/simout-N*)

Step 8:

Create Coverage Reports

Inputs:
  Z01X created design database and executable
  Z01X created Fault Definition File (sim.fdef)
Command:
  coverage(file=[sim.sff])
Outputs:
  Z01X created text fault coverage report
  Z01X created fault report logfile (fault_report.log)
  Z01X created fmsh log (fmsh.log)
